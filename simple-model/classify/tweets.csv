@BarackObama,"Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time — and turkey, and maybe a little football — with the ones we love. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.pic.twitter.com/GEZSGaNSGe"
@BarackObama,"Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: ""Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity."""
@BarackObama,"Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021:"
@BarackObama,"Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization."
@BarackObama,Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month.
@BarackObama,"Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation."
@BarackObama,"Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt."
@BarackObama,"This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country"
@BarackObama,"No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders."
@BarackObama,"Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy."
@BarackObama,"Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics.pic.twitter.com/IljmKBq7Gm"

@BarackObama,"Happy #DayoftheGirl! I’m excited to share that in December, I’ll be visiting Vietnam to meet some of the inspiring girls from the @GirlsAlliance community and the organizations that work so hard to support their dreams.    I can't wait to share their stories with you."

@BarackObama,"Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional."
@BarackObama,"As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why.

@BarackObama,"One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it."
@BarackObama,"Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her.pic.twitter.com/VgCPAaDp3C"
@BarackObama,That’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here:
@BarackObama,"Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he’d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees."
@BarackObama,Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate.
@BarackObama,"As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day."
@BarackObama,"Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight."
@BarackObama,"Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more."
@BarackObama,"Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it—keep it up, David! That’s some creative organizing."
@BarackObama,"Training is at the heart of organizing. It’s why I’ve always made it a priority – from my 2008 campaign until now. And it’s why I’m proud to announce @allontheline’s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U. Join us: "
@BarackObama,"With summer winding down, here’s a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow. Hope you enjoy.pic.twitter.com/BS5ri1lvxz"
@BarackObama,"A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. It can help you find common ground.

@BarackObama,"Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page.
