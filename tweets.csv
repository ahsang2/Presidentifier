@BarackObama,"Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time — and turkey, and maybe a little football — with the ones we love. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.pic.twitter.com/GEZSGaNSGe"
@BarackObama,"Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: ""Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity."""
@BarackObama,"Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021:"
@BarackObama,"Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization."
@BarackObama,Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month.
@BarackObama,"Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation."
@BarackObama,"Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt."
@BarackObama,"This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country"
@BarackObama,"No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders."
@BarackObama,"Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy."
