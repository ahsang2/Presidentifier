@BarackObama,"Today, we give thanks for our blessings, give back to those around us, and enjoy some time — and turkey, and maybe a little football — with the ones we love. From the Obama family to yours, Happy Thanksgiving.pic.twitter.com/GEZSGaNSGe"
@BarackObama,"Before arguing with friends or family around the Thanksgiving table, take a look at the science behind arguing better. And it'll never hurt to try this: ""Listen to people, get them to think about their own experience, and highlight your common humanity."""
@BarackObama,"Politicians shouldn’t be picking their voters. Voters should be picking their representatives. But unless we act, the status quo will remain in states all across the country. Let's make sure maps are drawn fairly when redistricting happens again in 2021:"
@BarackObama,"Take a look at this piece to understand the very real consequences of gerrymandering. In Asheville, NC, we see what happens when district lines are drawn for maximum partisan advantage: It mean citizens’ voices are diminished. It means more polarization."
@BarackObama,Young leaders like these are powering the promise of the Asia Pacific region. Michelle and I couldn’t be more impressed by their initiative. Can’t wait to join them in Malaysia next month.
@BarackObama,"Proud to see Oluwaseun @AyodejiOsowobi in this list. She’s an @ObamaFoundation Leader who’s organizing young people in Nigeria to help end sexual violence, and her work embodies what our foundation is all about: passing the baton to the next generation."
@BarackObama,"Stories like this are a reminder of our duty, as a country and as Americans, to support every veteran—not only in words, but in deed. To every veteran out there, thank you. We’re forever in your debt."
@BarackObama,"This Veterans Day, here’s a moving portrait of the extraordinary resilience of my friend Cory Remsburg, an Army Ranger I’ve come to know over the years. It’s an honest tribute to all those wounded warriors and their families who give so much to our country"
@BarackObama,"No one says it better than @MichelleObama — the Obama Presidential Center coming to the South Side isn't for us, it's for the community and the next generation of leaders."
@BarackObama,"Proud of all the Americans who showed up to vote yesterday, electing a set of hopeful, forward-thinking leaders primed to protect Medicaid, draw fair voting maps, and reduce gun violence. A great night for our country—one that’ll leave a lasting legacy."
@BarackObama,"Proud to endorse an outstanding group of Virginia Democrats in Tuesday’s election—candidates who’ll not only advance the causes of equality, justice, and decency, but help ensure that the next decade of voting maps are drawn fairly. That’s good policy—and good for our politics.pic.twitter.com/IljmKBq7Gm"
@BarackObama,Today’s the first day of open enrollment on 
@BarackObama,"Congrats to the World Champion @Nationals and their fans! A great group that always showed up when it counted and was never afraid to show a little joy: dancing in the dugout, laughing, believing, and always sticking together. A true team with a spirit that’d do us all well."
@BarackObama,Watch live: @BarackObama is about to take the stage at the #ObamaSummit. Tune in now at 
@BarackObama,Take a tour with @BarackObama through the future Obama Presidential Center on Chicago’s South Side.pic.twitter.com/n5n6sxRz1E
@BarackObama,"Glad to be back in Chicago for the @ObamaFoundation Summit. It’s where I first learned to organize—and where I met @MichelleObama. We all have places that define us, and at the Summit, we’ll be exploring the meaning behind them—tune in tomorrow at "
@BarackObama,".@SamanthaJPower is a Pulitzer winner, an incredible writer, and a great friend. Her memoir, The Education of an Idealist, grapples with the balance between idealism, pragmatism, advocacy, and governance. It's a must-read for anyone who cares about our role in a changing world."
@BarackObama,"Michelle and I are heartbroken over the passing of our friend, Elijah Cummings. May his example inspire more Americans to pick up the baton and carry it forward in a manner worthy of his service.pic.twitter.com/lM2rES3PNV"
@BarackObama,"I was proud to work with Justin Trudeau as President. He's a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change. The world needs his progressive leadership now, and I hope our neighbors to the north support him for another term."
@BarackObama,"In December, Michelle and I will head to Malaysia for the first @ObamaFoundation Leaders: Asia-Pacific gathering. The region plays an important role in my own story, and today, it’s home to a generation of rising leaders ready to create a better world. We can’t wait to join them.pic.twitter.com/ldFDwXMi8J"
@BarackObama,"Yesterday, marathoner Eliud Kipchoge became the first ever to break two hours. Today in Chicago, Brigid Kosgei set a new women’s world record. Staggering achievements on their own, they’re also remarkable examples of humanity’s ability to endure—and keep raising the bar."
@BarackObama,"Happy #DayoftheGirl! I’m excited to share that in December, I’ll be visiting Vietnam to meet some of the inspiring girls from the @GirlsAlliance community and the organizations that work so hard to support their dreams.    I can't wait to share their stories with you."
@BarackObama,"Congrats to the @WashMystics on a gutsy, first-ever championship! A great team performance when it counted. If folks aren’t careful, this title thing might become a habit in DC."
@BarackObama,"Here’s an interesting read—a reminder that behind every opinion lies a human being with real experiences and a story to tell. Sometimes we’ll agree and sometimes we won’t, but if we want our democracy work, listening to each other isn’t optional."
@BarackObama,"As President, I leaned on @AmbassadorRice’s experience, expertise, and willingness to tell me what I needed to hear. In her memoir, Tough Love, you’ll see why. It’s a tribute to American leadership—and a unifying call for us to do our part to protect it. I hope you’ll read it.pic.twitter.com/7iUWt76xUw"
@BarackObama,"Like the Beatles said: It’s getting better all the time. Thanks, babe, for 27 amazing years!pic.twitter.com/mImRqIYn1R"
@BarackObama,"On National Voter Registration Day, it’s up to us as citizens to make sure everyone we know can make their voices heard at the ballot box. Check and update your registration at "
@BarackObama,"One challenge will define the future for today’s young generation more dramatically than any other: Climate change. The millions of young people worldwide who’ve organized and joined today’s #ClimateStrike demand action to protect our planet, and they deserve it."
@BarackObama,"Just 16, @GretaThunberg is already one of our planet’s greatest advocates. Recognizing that her generation will bear the brunt of climate change, she’s unafraid to push for real action. She embodies our vision at the @ObamaFoundation: A future shaped by young leaders like her.pic.twitter.com/VgCPAaDp3C"
@BarackObama,That’s what Americans do when others are in need – we help. We give. We inspire. Want to make a difference? There are a number of ways you can help right here:
@BarackObama,"Jermaine Bell is just six years old, but when he saw people in need, he took the money he’d been saving for a trip to Disney World and spent it on food and water for South Carolina evacuees."
@BarackObama,Bahamian families and communities face a long recovery from Hurricane Dorian. And Americans are reaching out to help. Brittany Garvin is helping people reunite and evacuate.
@BarackObama,"As we remember those we lost on 9/11, we also remember the spirit of unity and togetherness that defined the weeks and months after. On this day of service, I’m reflecting on all those still working to embrace that spirit, today and every day."
@BarackObama,"Marca had a remarkable way of bringing out the best within us. For me, she was a trusted voice and a persistent, buoyant spirit—an example that progress can be slow, but it’s always possible. We’ll miss her, but we’re far better off because of her fight."
@BarackObama,"Yesterday’s ruling is a big win for North Carolina—and for all of us. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. This win is proof that change is always within our reach, on gerrymandering, voting rights, and much more."
@BarackObama,"Saw this story of a young person doing great work and wanted to share it—keep it up, David! That’s some creative organizing."
@BarackObama,"Training is at the heart of organizing. It’s why I’ve always made it a priority – from my 2008 campaign until now. And it’s why I’m proud to announce @allontheline’s in-person training initiative, Redistricting U. Join us: "
@BarackObama,"With summer winding down, here’s a sampling of what Michelle and I have been listening to — some new, some old, some fast, some slow. Hope you enjoy.pic.twitter.com/BS5ri1lvxz"
@BarackObama,"A good story gives you the chance to better understand someone else’s life. It can help you find common ground. And it’s why Michelle and I were drawn to Higher Ground’s first film, American Factory. Take a look at our conversation with the directors, and check it out on Netflix.pic.twitter.com/KzkYFqjrFV"
@BarackObama,"Toni Morrison was a national treasure, as good a storyteller, as captivating, in person as she was on the page. Her writing was a beautiful, meaningful challenge to our conscience and our moral imagination. What a gift to breathe the same air as her, if only for a while.pic.twitter.com/JG7Jgu4p9t"
@BarackObama,"Until all of us stand up and insist on holding public officials accountable for changing our gun laws, these tragedies will keep happening:"
@BarackObama,pic.twitter.com/nNOVtQ50O4
@BarackObama,"The families of our wounded warriors don't often get a lot of fanfare, but they're serving and sacrificing right alongside their loved ones. We all owe a debt to them, too, and Fisher House is always making sure we're serving those who serve us."
@BarackObama,Recent court decisions make it clear that the change we need to restore our democracy has to come from the ground up. @Allontheline’s work to ensure an accurate census count and achieve fair maps in 2021 has never been more important. Join us today: 
@BarackObama,"Here’s a worthwhile Sunday read: “…nothing should temper partisanship more than an awareness that somewhere, on some issue, people with whom you disagree are telling a story that you really need to hear.”"
@BarackObama,"I’ve always been proud of what this team accomplished during my administration. But more than what we did, I’m proud of how they’re continuing to fight for an America that’s better."
@BarackObama,"Leaders: Africa may have ended, but 200 inspiring #ObamaLeaders returned to their homes with the new connections and fresh perspectives that will help them change the future. "
@BarackObama,"Economist Raj Chetty is not only identifying the decline in opportunity we’ve seen in recent decades—but trying to reverse it. Inequality, like many problems we face, is as vast as it is complex. But this article left me a little more hopeful:"
@BarackObama,Here are a couple of articles backed by new research that are worth taking a look at: A new study on the Medicaid expansion my administration fought for under the Affordable Care Act—and how these policy decisions affect lives in real terms:
@BarackObama,"In America, we don’t fear the future, we embrace it. 50 years ago, that spirit took us to the moon. Today, it’s embodied by people like Tiffany Davis. She’s a young rocket scientist who is helping us explore the next frontier, wherever that might take us."
@BarackObama,"What truly makes our country great is its diversity. I’ve seen that beauty in so many ways over the years. Whether we are born here or seek refuge here, there’s a place for us all. We must remember it’s not my America or your America. It’s our America."
@BarackObama,"#MandelaDay reminds us that when things feel dark, confusing, or impossible—take a look back at his writings. There, we see how a belief in the dignity of every person can be made real, an unwavering hope to steel us along our own long walks toward something better.pic.twitter.com/fKgrVRiHhc"
@BarackObama,"I have a good feeling about these Chicago @UrbanAlliance interns. Thanks for letting me spend yesterday afternoon with you—you’re going to go on to do incredible things and make many people proud. In fact, you already have.pic.twitter.com/ZjzFQmBQqm"

@BarackObama,"50 years ago, history was written at the Stonewall Inn when New York's LGBT community stood up, spoke out, and started a movement.

@BarackObama,"Outside the Oval Office, I kept a painting of a small crowd huddled around a pocketwatch, waiting for the moment the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. On Juneteenth, we celebrate the anniversary of that news - freedom - reaching slaves in Texas. And something more:pic.twitter.com/kSkLHbfnc3"
@BarackObama,"This is worth a read: a thought-provoking reminder that education reform isn’t a cure-all. As a supporter of education reform, I agree that fixing educational inequality requires doing more to address the broader, systemic sources of economic inequality."
@BarackObama,"Yes we can, Greta. I’m hopeful because of you and all the young people who are fighting to protect the planet. Keep at it."

@BarackObama,"Last week, it was Virginia Beach. But day after day and year after year, too many families and communities are shattered by senseless gun violence. We can't get numb to this. On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, pledge to speak out, #WearOrange — and vote — to protect lives."
