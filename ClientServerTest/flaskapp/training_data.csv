@JoeBiden,A job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It’s about dignity. It’s about being able to look your kid in the eye and say everything is going to be okay—and mean it. Too many people today can’t do that.  We have to rebuild an inclusive middle class and restore the dignity of work.
@JoeBiden,This administration is morally bankrupt.
@JoeBiden,We need a president who is respected on the world stage.pic.twitter.com/Hqv6T06Mtv
@JoeBiden,"Congratulations @AFLCIO on 64 years of empowering workers to bargain for what they deserve. The 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety — it’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that."
@JoeBiden,"Nuestro presidente debería ser capaz de cumplir con una prueba simple: entender que los puertorriqueños son ciudadanos americanos y que tienen derecho a, y merecen, el mismo apoyo del gobierno de los Estados Unidos que todos los demás ciudadanos."
@JoeBiden,"Our president should be able to meet a simple test: understanding that Puerto Ricans are American citizens, and that they are entitled to—and deserve—the same support from the United States government as every citizen.  Donald Trump has failed that test."

@JoeBiden,Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.  We must make him a one-term president.
@JoeBiden,"It's clear who President Trump works for. His administration prioritized giant tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations — meanwhile, they've attacked food assistance every chance they've gotten. It’s heartless.  No one should go hungry in America."

@JoeBiden,"26 years ago, I fought to get the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act passed — and established the background check system that has kept guns out of the hands of so many dangerous individuals.  I’ve taken on the @NRA and beaten them — twice. As president, I’ll do it again."

@JoeBiden,"President Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in modern American history. At every turn, he has used the power of the presidency to benefit his own personal interests. It has got to end.  I'll ensure our government works for all Americans — not just the powerful."

@JoeBiden,"Yesterday, on the eve of #HumanRightsDay, Trump again coddled a dictator—blocking a UN meeting on North Korean human rights, betraying our values. Trump continues to side with the brutal Kim Jong Un regime at the expense of American leadership, our allies, and our security."
@JoeBiden,.@DrBiden and I join communities around the world in marking #HumanRightsDay. This day is a time of reflection and recommitment to the notion that all human beings are equal in dignity and rights.
@JoeBiden,"It’s been just two months since John Deere laid off 160 workers in the Quad Cities in part because of President Trump’s reckless trade war—and now, a second round of layoffs is expected in the same community.  Trump’s failed policies are destroying American jobs."

@JoeBiden,Small businesses are the backbone of our nation’s economy.  That’s why supporting entrepreneurs is so vital to our campaign.  Our latest stop was Food for the Soul in Abbeville where @JoeBiden officially filed to be on the SC primary ballot!pic.twitter.com/SjzupEUqZZ

@JoeBiden,"It's the final day of the #NoMalarkey barnstorm, but the enthusiasm we’ve seen could make a big difference in the next few weeks before the Iowa Caucus.  We need your help to keep this momentum going—contribute today to keep fueling our efforts: "
@JoeBiden,House Democrats have passed legislation to:   - Enact universal background checks - Reauthorize VAWA  It’s time for @senatemajldr McConnell to do his job and bring these bills up for a vote.

@JoeBiden,We deserve to know what Donald Trump is hiding.
@JoeBiden,"Today, House Democrats led the way by passing a bill to restore the Voting Rights Act. All but one Republican voted against it. Shameful. Strengthening our democracy should not be a partisan issue. #HR4 #RestoreTheVote"
@JoeBiden,"The Voting Rights Act used to be one of our best tools to fight state laws designed to suppress the vote — particularly the votes of people of color. Then it was gutted by the Supreme Court, and Congressional Republicans have refused a legislative fix."

@ewarren,Children are dying in CBP custody due to the flu. Refusing to administer flu vaccines is neglectful and cruel. I'll end the unnecessary detention of children and families—and enforce strict standards for medical care for anyone in our care.
@ewarren,Facebook is allowing entities to target misleading and false ads about HIV prevention drugs to LGBTQ+ communities and others. This can have serious public health consequences. Facebook needs to put the safety of its users above its own advertising profits.

@ewarren,"Thank you, Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, I’m so grateful for your work on our #BlueNewDeal!"

@BernieSanders,You might recall @scottdetrow talking in a previous pod episode about this emotional moment when a vet at a Sanders rally in Nevada talked about feeling like he could commit suicide because of his high medical bills.   The story has an update.  
@BernieSanders,Tomorrow: join Campaign Manager @fshakir for a Reddit AMA on 
@BernieSanders,"Every day, a new cruelty of the health care system makes itself clear. In this case, public scrutiny was thankfully enough to help this man, but countless others still struggle. That's what this whole thing is about."
@BernieSanders,At this moment in our history despair is not an option. I've got four kids and seven grandchildren. I can't give up. You can't give up.
@BernieSanders,This is America. You should not go bankrupt because you're diagnosed with a serious illness.
@BernieSanders,Deductibles are one of the most outrageous concepts in the history of the world. We're going to eliminate them under Medicare for All.
@BernieSanders,"Our health care system works extremely well for health insurance executives looking to get rich.  For everyone else, it is an outrage.  Medicare for All now."
@BernieSanders,"I relish the idea of defeating Trump, the most dangerous president in history. But more importantly, I look forward to working with millions of you to create a government of compassion, not hate. Live from Carson City:"
@BernieSanders,"The insurance companies are lying about Medicare for All.  Medicare for All means freedom.  It is the freedom to go to the doctor, hospital or clinic of your choice.  It's the freedom to see a doctor when you need to, regardless of your income or zip code.pic.twitter.com/lkYibBKlAu"

@BernieSanders,Long-term care is health care. Home and community-based services will be covered under Medicare for All.
@BernieSanders,".@CASAinAction knows that real change never comes from the top on down but from the bottom on up.  Together we will win the nomination, sweep Trump out of the White House and build a movement of justice that brings our people together and confronts all forms of discrimination."
@BernieSanders,"Under President Trump, the very concept of democracy is under attack. We are going to defeat Trump and Trumpism and take our democracy back from the corporate elite. Live in Elko, NV:"
@BernieSanders,"We are running a campaign of the working class, by the working class, and for the working class of this country."
@BernieSanders,Are you willing to fight for a person you don’t know as much as you’re willing to fight for yourself?
@BernieSanders,Mental health care is health care. It will be covered by Medicare for All.
@BernieSanders,"Right now, if you are poor, government turns its back on you, yet it welcomes the wealthy and their lobbyists. That is totally backwards."
@BernieSanders,"Americans deserve a government that works for all, not just the 1%, their lobbyists and their campaign contributors. In a Bernie Sanders administration we will build an economy based on justice for the working class."
@BernieSanders,“Amazon is taking the space without any ... special tax credits and other inducements”  So about that $3 billion...
@BernieSanders,"When I met John, a veteran, a few months ago, he had $139,000 in medical debt.  Thankfully today he is doing much better.  We must eliminate all medical debt—and when our veterans come home, they must receive the best quality health care this country can provide them.pic.twitter.com/URQfPkBsnS"
@BernieSanders,"I don’t want us to just go back to where we were before Trump. I want us to ask some hard questions that we as a nation rarely do:  How is health care not a right in the richest country in the world? Why do one in six of our children go hungry? Why are 500,000+ people homeless?"
@BernieSanders,"Donald Trump thinks he can win re-election by dividing us up. He is dead wrong. We are the strongest campaign to beat Trump because we are bringing people together with a multiracial, working-class movement."
@BernieSanders,Young people are ready for a political revolution.
@BernieSanders,"Today I’m celebrating my 18th birthday by registering to vote and doing EVERYTHING I can to elect @BernieSanders as the next president of the United States!  We need all hands on deck for #Bernie2020 , so join me by downloading the #BERN app  "
@BernieSanders,Have you ever received a huge medical bill despite having private health insurance?
@BernieSanders,Why do you think the rich and powerful make such enormous political contributions?  They may be greedy — but they are not stupid.  We do not have and we do not want the funding of the billionaire class.
@BernieSanders,"It’s because immigrant youth fight for justice, black workers demand fair pay, women stand in their power, that I know we can build the country of our dreams.  Today 500,000 of us at @CPDAction are joining millions to build this country alongside Tio @BernieSanders #SiSePuede"

@BernieSanders,Ask me anything at 
@BernieSanders,"The outrageous abuse taking place at Glenwood and Woodward Resource Centers under Gov. Reynolds’ administration must end now. We must end the institutional bias that forces people with disabilities out of their communities, and instead guarantee home and community-based services."

@BernieSanders,"Like Uncle @BernieSanders says, despair is not an option.  You have to believe something is possible before you can achieve it. Hopelessness and despair will get us nowhere.  We know that we can avert the climate crisis and shape a better future.   We won't give up either."
@BernieSanders,The honor is ours Senator. Our people deserve a movement candidate that will be unapologetic about their commitment to our freedom. Can’t wait to join you in the streets to secure this primary victory & defeat Trumpism in 2020.
@BernieSanders,"Proud to report @CPDAction is endorsing @BernieSanders. Our network of grassroots social movement orgs - 600K families - has united behind a bold vision for racial/economic/climate justice, to work with Sen. Sanders to win the WH & social transformation."
@BernieSanders,"I’m proud to be endorsed by @CPDAction. Together we’re going to build a movement for racial, social and economic justice made up of working class Americans that will bring millions of people together and transforms our country so it works for all of us."
@BernieSanders,The American people have been ripped off by pharmaceutical companies for too long.  Some politicians are willing to allow that.  I'm not going to take it anymore.  We're going to end pharma's greed and cap out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $200 a year.

@amyklobuchar,"We can’t afford to underestimate the threat of cyberattacks on our elections, economy & infrastructure. I’ve led on cybersecurity in the Senate — as President, I’ll protect our elections, invest in our cyber workforce & strengthen our cyber defenses."
@amyklobuchar,"We’re building a campaign that can #WinBig. That means working hard, meeting people where they are, and bringing them with us. And it’s working."

@amyklobuchar,"Today I released my plan for the future of work and our changing economy. Thank you @MartiIowa, Jennifer Foster, @BontraM and Randy Tucker for joining our roundtable at the Machinists Union Lodge.  We will stand with workers and fight for economic justice. "

Now, our coalition of 4,000 cities, states, & businesses represent more than 68% of US GDP, 65% of the US population, & more than half of US emissions.pic.twitter.com/yd6eqv9d0G"

@MikeBloomberg,"President Trump has taken steps to pull out of the global effort to combat climate change. That’s why I stepped in, helping create America’s Pledge, bringing together nearly 4,000 U.S. cities, states, and businesses that remain dedicated to meeting our climate goals."
@MikeBloomberg,"Leadership isn’t about shaking your fist at the world, or putting ideas up on a website, or tweeting. It’s about bringing people together, to solve problems, and get results. And that’s what I want to do as president - by taking near-term climate action."
